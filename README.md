# CS8803DLM-HackSayCan
Created for CS8803 DLM Hacker Role for SayCan Paper (Spring 2024)

This repo includes:
- requirements.txt (in case you want to try)
- my notebooks derived from [here](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/saycan)
  - with saved outputs
  - notebook license derives from Google Research (Apache 2.0)
  - code is the same between notebooks, I saved separate outputs for different models
  - I have some snippets of test code here and there - it should be pretty obvious
- my slides with a description of what I did
